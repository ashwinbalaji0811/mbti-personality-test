# MBTI Personality Test
This is an attempt to implement MBTI Personality Assessment only using `JS` and a flat-file CMS `typemill` so that you can deploy it anywhere (even in your PC) to use!

But to generate reports, you will need to have `php` installed. Just upload via FTP to your webserver (`Apaceh`) or use `wamp64` or `xampp`.  Else use my releases to run natively in Windows and Linux.

macOS buils are on their way soon!!
